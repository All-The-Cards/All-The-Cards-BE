## Technologies

This project is coded in JavaScript, using a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) variant. This project also utilizes [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for the tables pertaining to the catalog of data. The catalog of data is courtesy of [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api).

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system. Unzip the folder, open PowerShell or Bash in that folder, and run `npm install`. Then you can run `npm start` to execute the backend. Most of the requests are `POST` methods. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is best suited for sending requests.

## Development Setup

The URL is [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for Postman. Many of the requests can be found above in this document.
